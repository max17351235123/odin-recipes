    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole fish</li>
        <li>2 stalk scallions</li>
        <li>1 small piece of ginger</li>
        <li>1&1/2 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 dried chili</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shaoxing rice wine</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the fish thoroughly then pat dry with kitchen paper. Cut 
            the fish at a 45-degree angle several times on each side. Lay it
            onto a plate that fits in the wok/pot which you’ll use to 
            steam.</li>
        <li> Put ⅓ of the scallions and ginger into the cavity of the fish. S
            catter the rest under and over the fish. </li>
        <li>Place a steamer rack (or a small bowl) in the middle of a wok. 
            Add water to the pot (lower than the rack/bowl) and bring it 
            to a full boil.</li>
        <li>Put the fish plate on top of the rack (bowl). Cover the wok 
            with a lid. Steam over high heat for 8 minutes (add 2 more 
            minutes if your fish is larger).</li>
        <li>Take out the plate (use oven gloves to avoid burning). Carefully remove the cloudy liquid. </li>
        <li>Heat up oil, dried chili and Sichuan pepper in a small pan over low heat. As soon as the oil starts to smoke, pour it over the fish (you may either pour the spices onto the fish or discard them).</li>
        <li>Add light soy sauce, Shaoxing rice wine, sugar and white pepper to the same pan. Heat up until it bubbles. Pour over the fish.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with plain rice (Don’t forget to dip the flesh into the sauce for best flavour).</li>
    </ol>
